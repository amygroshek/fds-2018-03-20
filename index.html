					<h2>Gilbert & Gubar</h2>
					<blockquote>Gilbert and Gubar argued that the "maddened doubles" in texts by women writers of the nineteenth and twentieth century "function as social surrogates," projecting women writers' anxiety of authorship in a male-dominated literary tradition (Donaldson, 99)</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Feminism & Madness</h2>
					<ol>
						<li class="fragment"><strong>Contemporary to</strong> the development of the social model of disability</li>
						<li class="fragment">Emphasis on authorship, makes sense for literary criticism... extension to disability studies...</li>
						<li class="fragment">Presumed whiteness, cis- and straight-ness, and class position of the "mad" women in question</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Donaldson</h2>
					<blockquote>
						A feminist disability studies reading that stresses the connections between madness and physiognomy, between the mind and body, provides us with an alternate way of conceptualizing madness in <i>Jane Eyre</i>... to complicate the current constructions of madness within feminist theory. (102)</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Donaldson</h2>
						<ul><li><strong>Phrenology:</strong> Assessment (often racialized) of human capacity based on size & shape of the skull. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Lombroso">Cesare Lombroso</a></li><li><strong>Physiognomy:</strong> The assessment of character from outward appearance, particularly the face. (Especially prevalent in <i>Jane Eyre</i>.)</li></ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>"The Yellow Wallpaper"</h2>
					<p>The feminist reading of the novel is somewhat at odds with the disability studies or crip reading of the novel... <strong>Because</strong> the feminist reading of the novel needs to invest in the medical model of disability in order to critique patriarchal society.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Impairment and Disability</h2>
					<blockquote>
						A feminist disabilty studies reading... demands closer attention to physical bodies and to the theories of embodiment that structure the novel (110)
					</blockquote>
					<p>In particular, physiognomy in the 19th century... though Donaldson argues that it carries over into contemporary studies in neuroscience: "all share a basic understanding of the brain as a territory to be mapped" (110)</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Donaldson on the Medical Model</h2>
					<p>Citing Simi Linton...</p>
					<blockquote>
						[M]edical definitions of disability in the past have functioned to keep disabilty "within the purview of the medical establishment, to keep it a personal matter and 'treat' the condition and the person with the condition rather than the 'treating' the social processes and policies that constrict disabled people's lives (110)
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Price, "Mental Disability"</h2>
					<blockquote>
						These days I'm using <i>mental disability</i>... can include not only madness but also cognitive and intellecutal dis/abilities of various kinds (305)
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						we need <i>both</i> specificity <i>and</i> broad coalitions... Persons with impaired bodyminds have been segregated from one another enough (304)
					</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Price: "bodymind"</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Misfitting</strong>, bringing mental disability into considerations of misfitting (272)</li>
						<li>Considerations of harm</li>
						<li>The problem with a unification of crip and mental disabilty <strong>&rarr;</strong> sometimes disability actually does result in a harmful <strong>reality</strong>... what then?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>The Undesireability of Disability</h2>
					<blockquote>[S]ome manifestations of disability, such as severe mental distress or chronic pain, are in and of themselves undesireable. (276)</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Concern with Neoliberal Narratives of Individuality and Political Will</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Donaldson</li>
						<li>Price</li>
						<li>Minich</li>
						<li>Kim</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Minich</h2>
					<blockquote>the embrace of disability studies might foster complacency about ongoing injustices faced by disabled people... what do we want our work to <i>do</i>? ... [proposing a methodology] Turn away from work that objectifies disability.</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Kim</h2>
					<blockquote>I want to draw out some of the possibilities for coalition between women-of-color / queer-of-color feminist and disability theorizing... radiate our scholarship outward from the single-issue terrain of disability identity... </blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>More Kim</h2>
					<blockquote>Rather than reading for evidence of self-ownership or resistance, then, [this method] reads for relations of social, material, and prosthetic supportâ€”that is, the various means through which lives are enriched, enabled, and made possible.</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Puar</h2>
					<p>The violent production of disabled bodies, "right to maim"</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Diane Price Herndl</h2>
					<blockquote>Then I rethought what I meant by feminist theory and realized that feminist relations to the body are different now than they were twenty years ago for Lorde and feminist relations to breast cancer are different... I didn't have to wear breast cancer in the same way. (150)
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Diane Price Herndl & the Posthuman</h2>
					<blockquote>[T]o say that I chose to become posthuman is a lie. From the moment that I began my interaction with technology (And when was that? I ask myself. When I had the first mammogram? When they did the first surgery?... When I was born?), I was already posthuman. Is my new "breast" any less a visible sign of my interaction with technology than a mastectomy scar would be? (153)</blockquote>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Lorde</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Nurse shames Lorde for not wearing "form," bad for morale (52)</li>
						<li>"[I]n the process of losing a breast I had become a more whole person" (56)</li>
						<li>ACA's emphasis on prosthesis rather than disease rates and preventable risk factors (59)</li>
						<li>"Suggesting prosthesis as a solution to employment discrimination is like saying that the way to fight race prejudice is for Black people to pretend to be white" (68)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Questions</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Is Price Herndl correct that feminist relations to breast cancer have changed? Have they changed for all women?</li>
						<li>What do you think about the appeal to posthumanism in Price Herndl's essay? Are you comfortable with it?</li>
